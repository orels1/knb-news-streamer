  "body": "### What is this?\r\nThis is KNB-news-streamer, KNB stands for kanobu, a website this was made for. Basically - the purpose of this service is to monitor desired twitter streams and sort it for most popular stuff, so you can always have a list of relevant and widely-shared news to write/read about. \r\n#### For ~~nerds~~ those who are wondering\r\nBackend: node.js + socket.io  \r\nFrontend: react + flux  \r\nJust as everything I do... real hipster kind.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nFor all you visual consumers, [a little demo](https://knb-news-streamer.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\n### Deployment on Heroku\r\nIt's pretty straightforward, fork the repository, create a heroku dyno and deploy from github. Don't forget to set `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`,`TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`,`TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY` and `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` env.variables in settings, and connect mongolab DB, or it won't work (obviously). Then you just deploy, open and press \"Start Streaming\" button in top-right corner.\r\n\r\n### Deployment on a VPS/Localhost/Any other server\r\nYou need to have `Gulp`, `Bower` and `mongoDB` installed. You can specify mongoDB URI with `MONGOLAB_URI` ENV variable, otherwise it will search on localhost.  \r\nClone the repo, run `npm install` and `npm start`, that should do the trick. Don't forget to set ENV variables as in Heroku deployment.\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nIf you want to develop your own features - after `npm install` run `npm run watch` and `gulp default` **nodemon is required**. Server will now rebuild all the stuff on change.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n* Add more sorting options\r\n* Add proper search (there is an interface ready, need to implement backend)\r\n* Add more services for feeds: reddit, neogaf\r\n* Autoupdate feed stats with Cron\r\n\r\n### Issues and Bugs\r\nShould be submitted to an [issues](https://github.com/orels1/knb-news-streamer/issues) section of the repo, thanks!\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n[Kanobu](http://kanobu.ru) for requesting the service and yours truly @orels1.",
